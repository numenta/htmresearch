## Grid Cell Learning
This project contains code implementing some of the continuous attractor
grid cell learning models from Widloski & Fiete, 2014.  CAN.py contains a
straightforward implementation of a learning grid cell module, which employs
rate-coded neurons to learn an approximate CAN network across a 1D environment.

1D Learning.ipynb contains code to run and visualize this network, including a
confirmation that it generates a CAN network with gridlike firing.

In the future, this work may be extended to include 2D learning, and may also
be used in other, related learning problems.
