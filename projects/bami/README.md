#BaMI Experiments

This project hosts experiments discussed in ["Biological and Machine Intelligence (BaMI)"](http://numenta.com/biological-and-machine-intelligence/). BaMI is a living textbook, so it follows that the code here is subject to change.
<!--Code here matches the BaMI version numbers.-->

###Spatial Pooler

The intent of sp_tutorial.py is to help users understand and work with Spatial Pooler code. It replicates the examples and experiments presented in the BaMI Spatial Pooler chapter.
